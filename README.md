# AppContainer component contains navigation bar, Filter component, and InvestmentCardContainer which contains the InvestmentCard components

# Wasn't able to actually fetch the data from the gist but put commented out functions that could be used with an endpoint

# Make more mobile responsive, i.e. more dynamic width/height for investment cards

# Implement more sophisticated testing, i.e testing there is data being returned and not just components loading
